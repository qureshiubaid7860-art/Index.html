Education is the most <b>powerful tool</b> that helps in shaping the future of students. 
It allows them to develop skills, gain knowledge, and grow intellectually.

<h2><font color="red">Why Education Matters</font></h2>
<p>
Education teaches us how to think <i>critically</i>, communicate effectively, 
and behave responsibly in society. 
It is not just about learning from books but about developing <u>values</u> 
and understanding the importance of discipline.
</p>

<p>
As <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> says, 
<b><font color="purple">Education is a human right</font></b> with immense power to transform.

<h2><font color="red">Benefits of Being Educated</font></h2>
<p>
An educated person contributes positively to society. 
Education improves <i>self-confidence</i> and helps students achieve their goals 
while avoiding bad habits that destroy their potential.

<p>
It increases <b><font color="brown">creativity</font></b> and helps people solve real-life problems easily. <br>

<b>Success = Hard Work<sup>2</sup> + Consistency<sub>daily</sub></b>

<h2><font color="red">Role of Teachers and Parents</font></h2>
<p>
Teachers and parents play a <u>very important role</u> in a student’s education. 
They teach children what is <i>right and wrong</i> and help them believe in themselves.
</p>

<p>
According to <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>, 
emotional support from family and school helps students learn better.
